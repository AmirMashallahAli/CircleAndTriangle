# CircleAndTriangle
This is a java file (BlueJ) I did as a test worth 5% of the module.
It contains 3 files; test1, test2 and test3.
test 2 is an extension of test1.
test3 is where the user can calculate the area of their circle or triangle, fully automated (like a calculator).
When downloaded, please unzip the file so it functions properly.
